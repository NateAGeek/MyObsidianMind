# Overview
Convexity is a measure of how a bond will payout base on its correlation with [[Market Interest Rates]]. As rates go up the bond will need to compensate with a higher yield, causing the bond price to decrease. This is because the bond will need to yield more accommodate better payoff from other securities.
