# Derivatives
## Derivative
A derivative is a security that is tied to an underlying asset. It is dependent on the underlying asset for its value, and can a **linear** or **nonlinear** correlation to the asset. 

A **linear derivative** is a derivative of an asset that has a set linear convergence to a price/payoff. An example is a future contract will have a set value at maturity, and does not have to deal with strikes.

A **nonlinear derivative** is a derivative that does not have a linear convergence to a price/payoff. Rather the derivative value is determined by a complex structure that could be as simple as going "into the money" of a strike point. These are also time dependent and "space" dependent. Note, space is technically used here as where the price point falls  for the contract over time.
