## Overview

### Hypothetical Contract
Uses a Woody Carver, Jack Merchant, and Harvey. Basically, Carver is making some toys and with great success grows his business. Merchant then becomes the seller of Woody's work and sets up an agreement, Contract, to have preordered his toys to sell. However, soon realizing that demand is not fixed, and can variate for tons of risky reasons, gets approached by Harvey. Harvey and Merchant agree to make a new contract, to offset Merchant's risk, that Harvey will buy a portion of Merchants supply; and Harvey will sell it at a higher premium than Merchant for speculative gain. This seller and buyer interactions is meant to represent the basic idea of a contract.
