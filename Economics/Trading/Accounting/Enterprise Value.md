Enterprise Value is the value of the company you are paying for. It is the cash available on the balance sheet minus the debt that is on the balance sheet. This is how much you're paying for the company.

For example if the company has net assets value. So if the company has an asset worth 1 million but debt for  the company is 500,000, then the cost of the company is 1.5 million.
