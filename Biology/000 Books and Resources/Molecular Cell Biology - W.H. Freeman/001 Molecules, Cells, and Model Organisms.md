# Molecules, Cells, and Model Organisms

## Definitions
<span style="color: #BBFABB; font-weight: bold;">Genes</span>: Consist of [[001 Molecules, Cells, and Model Organisms#^53b9ff|DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)]], chemically composed structures of [[Nucleic Acids]], that encode [[Proteins]] to maintain functionality of the cellular body. 

<span style="color: #BBFABB; font-weight: bold;">DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)</span>: Is a molecule composed of two polynucleotide chains held together by hydrogen bonds, creating a double helix shape. The nucleotide are used to encode [[Proteins]]. ^53b9ff

<span style="color: #BBFABB; font-weight: bold;">Metazoa(Animalia)</span>: Is a categorization of multicellular life forms.

<span style="color: #BBFABB; font-weight: bold;">Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)</span>: is a molecule to readily store chemical energy for required functionality in the cell, in two bonds, when one bond is broken, ATP, is converted into [[001 Molecules, Cells, and Model Organisms#^44cdac|Adenosine Diphosphete (ADP)]]. ^462009

<span style="color: #BBFABB; font-weight: bold;">Adenosine Diphosphete (ADP)</span>: is the product of [[001 Molecules, Cells, and Model Organisms#^462009|Adenosine Triphosphate(ATP)]]. The remain two bonds of phosphate can be used for energy or can be converted back to [[001 Molecules, Cells, and Model Organisms#^462009|Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)]] with energy (however, the return of energy is greater if converted). ^44cdac

<span style="color: #BBFABB; font-weight: bold;">Monomer</span>: are small chemically bonded atoms or molecules used to create more complex structures. ^ab1f7d

<span style="color: #BBFABB; font-weight: bold;">Polymer</span>: is a large molecule that is composed of many repeatedly submits.

<span style="color: #BBFABB; font-weight: bold;">Amino Acids</span>: are 20 different are compounds that cells link together, creating a linear chain, to form proteins.

<span style="color: #BBFABB; font-weight: bold;">Enzyme</span>: are proteins that are functionality used to catalyze chemical reactions. 

<span style="color: #BBFABB; font-weight: bold;">Cytoskeletal Protein</span>: are proteins that are vital for the proteins that structure the cells skeletal system.

<span style="color: #BBFABB; font-weight: bold;">Nucleotides</span>: are [[001 Molecules, Cells, and Model Organisms#^ab1f7d|Monomers]] that are coding subunit for [[Nucleic Acids]].

<span style="color: #BBFABB; font-weight: bold;">Transcription</span>: is the process of converting the [[001 Molecules, Cells, and Model Organisms#^53b9ff|DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)]], into [[RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)]], and then into [[mRNA (Messager Ribonucleic Acid)]] to get translated via a [[Ribosome]] to create [[Proteins]].

<span style="color: #BBFABB; font-weight: bold;">Ribozymes</span>: are [[RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)]] enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions.

<span style="color: #BBFABB; font-weight: bold;">Ribozymes</span>: are [[RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)]] enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions.

%%<span style="color: #BBFABBA6; font-weight: bold;">Cell Cycle</span>: Is the series of cellular events that lead to cell division of two daughter cells.%%
