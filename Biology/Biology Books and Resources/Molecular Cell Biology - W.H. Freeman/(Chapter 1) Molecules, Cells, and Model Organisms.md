# Molecules, Cells, and Model Organisms

## Definitions
[[Genes]]: Consist of [[DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)]] chemically composed structures of [[Nucleic Acids]], that encode [[Proteins]] to maintain functionality of the cellular body. 

[[DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)]]: Is a molecule composed of two polynucleotide chains held together by hydrogen bonds, creating a double helix shape. The nucleotide are used to encode [[Proteins]].

[[Metazoa]] (Animalia): Is a categorization of multicellular life forms.

[[Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)]]: is a molecule to readily store chemical energy for required functionality in the cell, in two bonds, when one bond is broken, ATP, is converted into [[Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP)]].

[[Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP)]]: is the product of [[Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)]]. The remain two bonds of phosphate can be used for energy or can be converted back to [[Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)]] with energy (however, the return of energy is greater if converted).

[[Photosynthesis]]: is the process where plants utilize sunlight to create [[Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)]]

[[Monomer]]: are small chemically bonded atoms or molecules used to create more complex structures.

[[Polymer]]: is a large molecule that is composed of many repeatedly submits.

[[Amino Acids]]: are 20 different are compounds that cells link together, creating a linear chain, to form proteins.

[[Enzyme]]: are proteins that are functionality used to catalyze chemical reactions. 

[[Cytoskeletal Protein]]: are proteins that are vital for the proteins that structure the cells skeletal system.

Heredity: is the process of transferring genetically determined charactureistics to the next generation. 

[[Nucleotides]]: are [[(Chapter 1) Molecules, Cells, and Model Organisms#^ab1f7d|Monomers]] that are coding subunit for [[Nucleic Acids]].

[[Transcription]]: is the process of converting the [[DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)]], into [[RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)]] via [[RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) Polymerase]], and then into [[mRNA (Messenger Ribonucleic Acid)]] to get translated via a [[Ribosome]] to create [[Proteins]].

[[RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)]]: is a single strand complimtery of a DNA sequence, as a template, to create a chain of nucliotides.

[[RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) Polymerase]]: are large enzymes used to catalyze the nucleotides linkage creating [[RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)]], using the [[DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)]] as a template.

[[mRNA (Messenger Ribonucleic Acid)]]: is the processed RNA into smaller segments, that are moved from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for translation into a protein.

[[Ribosome]]: are large complex proteins that are used to translate the mRNA into their respective protein structure. There are other processes that might happen post translation, to properly form the protein's shape.

[[Translation]]: is the process of assembling amino acids, from the precise order of the mRNA instructions, into a fully formed protein. 

[[Ribozymes]]: are [[RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)]] enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions.

<span style="color: #BBFABB; font-weight: bold;">Transcription Factors</span>: are sequences of [[DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)]] that activate proteins to translate or covert the sequences into [[RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)]].

[[Cytosol]]: fluid that contains [[Organelles]] within the [[Cytoplasm]].s

[[Cytososkeleton]]: is a structural component that make up the cell's skeleton. The Cytososkeleton consists of three different fibers: [[Microtubules]], [[Microfilament]], and [[Intermediate Filament]].

[[Nucleolus]]: is the center most dense with [[DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)]] that encode genes for [[Proteins]].

[[Nuclear Pore Complexes]]: are ring like structures that material moves between the [[(Chapter 1) Molecules, Cells, and Model Organisms#^077ef9]] and the [[(Chapter 1) Molecules, Cells, and Model Organisms#^8a4681]].

[[Nuclear Lamina]]: are [[Intermediate Filament]] that provide structure for the [[Nucleolus]].

[[Genome]]: is the total genetic information in the organism.

[[Chromosomes]]: are the long structured segments of [[DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)]].

[[Heterochromatin]]: are dense concatenation of [[DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)]] that can not be transcribed into [[RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)]].

[[Endoplasmic Reticulum]]: Are closed flatten membranes that helps in the synthesis of [[Lipids]], secreted proteins, and other membrane proteins. ^65dc25

<span style="color: #BBFABB; font-weight: bold;">Cisternae</span>: are flatten membrane sacs within the [[Endoplasmic Reticulam]].

[[Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum]]: is smooth due to the lack of [[Ribosome|Ribosomes]]. It is typical site where lipids and phosphates is synthesis.

[[Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum]]: is rough due to the large presents of [[Ribosome|Ribosomes]]. Virtually all organelle proteins are created and translated in the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum.

[[Golgi Complex]]: is the apparatus that accepts proteins from the [[Endoplasmic Reticulam Vesides]]. It uses a series of enzymes to catalyze the necessary modifications to the protein that are moved into a [[Golgi Complex Vesicle]] that fuse with the cells membrane to release the generated protein.

[[Endocytosis]]: is the process of uptaking matter from outside the membrane. 

[[Endosome]]: is the uptake of aendocytic vesicel to then retake into the cell's body to be used, eventually these materials are degraded in [[Lysosmes]].

[[Lysosome]]: are responsible for breaking down material entered into the cell via [[Endocytosis]] or that internal material that has become obsolete. The internal obsolete material is consumed in a process called [[Autophagy]]. 

[[Phagocytosis]]: is the process of breaking down large insoluble material, like a bacteria, that are enveloped by the membrane.

[[Peroxisomes]]: are organelles that contain [[Oxidase]].

[[Oxidase]]: are enzymes that use oxygen molecules to oxidize inner cell substances.

[[Vacuole]]: are membrane-limited that are responsible for storing nutrients, water, and ions. They are membrane bonded.
