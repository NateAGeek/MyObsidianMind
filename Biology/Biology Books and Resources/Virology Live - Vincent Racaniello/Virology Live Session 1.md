## Bullet Notes
- Viruses are all around us, and are all over the place. We carry a lot of virus genetic material inside of us and all other live creatures
- There are 10^30 of just bacteriopases in the world's waters
- The length of head to tail 
- Wales are commonly are infected with Caliciviruses, wales excrete the more than 10^13
- Viruses help recycle biomaterial from cells and help other organisms grow and material to be reintroduced into the solution
- Herpes Viruses: HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, HCMV, EBV, HHV-6, HHV-7, HHV-8
- Microbiome: can contain and allow viruses and organisms to thrive, some note worthy
    - Respitory System
    - Stomach
    - Skin
    - Urpgenital Tract
- Virome: Are enviroments that allow viruses to coexist. Typically healthy humans can have the degree of RNA to DNA viruses on or in them that do not harm bodly functions(and may even help).
- Human Genome contains a ton of active and inactive virus encoding

    - LTR Retrotransposons: Are old sequences from retroviruses, one is used to make placentas
- Vast majority don't harm their host, many just pass through us(poop them out)
- Wasps inject polydavirus to infect the catapillar to immunosupress and protext the egg and be injected into the catapillar
- Polyomavirus: Don't seems to really affect humans
- **What is a Virus** Half way in session
- What are viruses: Are infecteous obligated intercellular parasite comprising pf DNA or RNA surrounded by protein coat and sometimes membrane
- Virion, as some viruses can come out none iffectouse and could be assemble later
- Viruses typically need electron microsoope or smaller
- Mimivirus: Really big viruses
- Pandoravirus: Are very laurge DNA based viruses
- Pithovirus: is the biggest virus
- Viruses are not like binary fission, they simply
