## Bullet Notes
- [[Viruses]] are all around us, and are all over the place. We carry a lot of virus genetic material inside of us and all other live creatures
- There are 10^30 of just [[Bacteriophages]] in the world's waters
- The length of head to tail 100 million light years
- Wales are commonly are infected with [[Caliciviridae]], wales excrete the more than 10^13
- [[Viruses]] help recycle biomaterial from cells and help other organisms grow and material to be reintroduced into the solution
- Herpes Viruses: [[Herpes Simplex 1|HSV-1]], [[Herpes Simplex 2|HSV-2]], VZV, HCMV, EBV, HHV-6, HHV-7, HHV-8
- [[Microbiome]]: can contain and allow viruses and organisms to thrive, some note worthy
    - [[Respiratory System]]
    - Stomach
    - Skin
    - Urogenital Tract
- Virome: Are environments that allow viruses to coexist. Typically healthy humans can have the degree of [[RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)|RNA]] to [[DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)|DNA]] viruses on or in them that do not harm bodily functions(and may even help).
- Human Genome contains a ton of active and inactive virus encoding
![[Overview of Affected Human DNA with Virus DNA.png|doi:10.1038/nrg1674]]
    - LTR Retrotransposons: Are old sequences from retroviruses, one is used to make placentas
- Vast majority don't harm their host, many just pass through us(poop them out)
- Wasps inject polyomavirus to infect the caterpillar to immunosuppressant and protects the egg and be injected into the caterpillar
- Polyomavirus: Don't seems to really affect humans
- **What is a Virus** Half way in session
- What are viruses: Are infectious obligated intercellular parasite comprising of [[DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)|DNA]] or [[RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)|RNA]] surrounded by protein coat and sometimes membrane
- Virion, as some viruses can come out none infectious and could be assemble later
- Viruses typically need electron microscope or smaller
- Mimivirus: Really big viruses
- Pandoravirus: Are very large DNA based viruses
- Pithovirus: is the biggest virus
- Viruses are not like binary fission, they simply massively divide after full on replication(usually exploding or killing the infected cell)
- Good question? Did viruses come before cells? They probably were there before
- Viruses are millions, possibly billions, of years old
- Viruses might have originated in murrains life
- Variolation, originated in China to vaccinate people. China would take puss from a old victim and give other people to develop immunity. 
- Leeuwenhoek made first microscope 
- Pasteur started to apply them
- Koch came up with the idea that microorganisms can get people sick
- 1728, virus word was created 
- early scientists discovered that they could filter them out, and that they can only effect hosts
- 1939 until we found out viruses are not liquids but rather particles. This was due to Electron microscope 
- eclipse period: does not see any replication of virus until it bam explodes and generates virus
- hierarchical classification of viruses
    - Kingdom
    - Phylum
    - Class
    - Order (virales)
    - Family (viridea)
    - Genus (virus)
    - Species
