## Bullet Notes
- Radio active nucldic  acids can allow you to tag DNA of viruses
- DNA typically contains the genetic info for all the encoding of the virus proteins
- There are seven kinds of viral genome classifications 
    - all need to make mRNA that can be transcribed by host ribosomes
    - The Baltimore Scheme - not a taxagenome, meaning it does not have a direct lineiage of vitals classification 
    - Type One: Double stranded DNA
    - Type Two: Single stranded DNA
    - Type Three: double stranded RNA
    - Type four: +RNA that goes into a -RNA intermediate 
    - Type Five: -RNA
    - Type Six: +RNA that gets transcripts to -DNA via reverse transcriptase 
    - Type Seven: Double Strand DNA
    - All these processes should be converted into mRNA
    - + complements a - strand of DNA or RNA
    - Not all + RNA is ribosome ready
    - Titles (Look back at this as it needs more details...)
        - dsDNA
        - Grappled dsDNA
        - ssDNA
        - dsRNA
        - ss (+) RNA
        - ss (-) RNA
        - ss (+) RNA with DNA intermediate 
- Viral genome are structured diverse 
    - Circular 
    - Linear
    - Gapped
    - Single
    - Ambisense 
- Information Encoded In Viral Genome
    - Protein Synthesis 
    - Replication viral genkmes
    - packaging if genome
    - Regulation for replication 
    - Host defenses
    - Spread possibilities for multiple hosts
    - **What are not**
        - No virus contains the complete protein synthesis 
        - Proteins that involve membrane biosynthesis 
        - *might change, who knows*
