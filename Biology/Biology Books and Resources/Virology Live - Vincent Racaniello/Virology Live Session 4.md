Virus Structure
- Subunit: are single polypeptides that are folded into a single unit
- Structural Unit: this is the unit of collection of subunits that will build a the capsid. Subunit or unit could be the same
- Capsid are made of structural units that surround the genome
- Evenlopes can surround the capsid, that could be surrounding the capsid. This is from the host cell derived. Lipid bilayer. Viruses can not make their own lipids
- Nucliocapsid are surrounding sub structure that are assembled within the structure, that are surrounded by an evenlop 
- Virus Capsids need to be Metastable, stable state to move and transport but need to become unstable for entry. There is an energy that the virus can be stable at, then when require, maybe via a receptor bond, the virus comes apart
- Capsids are held together by hydrogen binds and ionic bonds, none covalent
- Kimara, protein data bank, can visualize proteins or virus
- Virus Particles (3)
    - Helical: cylindrical 
    - Icosahedral: interconnecting hedral
    - Complex: cop out, just complex connections
- HBV and HPV Are vaccines are virus like the virus capsids that replace in the virus and neutralize it?(TODO review the vaccine structure)
- Vectors: areas of attacks from viruses
- Helical viruses are typically enveloped
- Helical viruses can be Rod like or Flexuos
- All capsize have precise number of proteins. Typically a multiple of 60.
- Spherical viruses come in many sizes
- Icosahedral Symmetry
- Icosahedron are 20 face equilateral
- Allows for the formation of a closed cell. This is why viruses likes to use them. Because it maximizes the subunit space with only multiple of 60 identical subunits needed. Very stable ver convenient.
- Bigger viruses don't change the size of their subunit. They add more subunits
- T number is used to describe size of viruses relative to subunits.
- T * 60 = number of subunits 
- Capsids arrange randomly . Usually in a factory region of the cell
