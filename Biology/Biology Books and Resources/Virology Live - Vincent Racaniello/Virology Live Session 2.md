## Bullet Notes
- The infection Cycle
    - Everything that happens from the virus going into the cell and exploding out
- susceptible cell is when the cell has a receptor for the virus to bind and insert itself into the cell
- Resistant cell means it does not have a receptor to bind or can not allow the virus replication
- Permissive cell has the capability to replicate the cell
- Only susceptible and permissive cell are the only types that can support virus infection cycle
- Embryo egg has been used to grow virus cultures 
- fibroblasts(need to define)
- continuous cell lines: basically immortal cells and are cancerous 
- Incubation happens at 37C and there is about 5% cubic carbon dioxide in the air for buffers
- Buffers are usually used to control deposits from cells to keep the alive. For example cells will deposit citric acid to maintain homeostasis. If a petre dish would to accumulate all the citric acid then the cell culture would die due to high acidity. Buffers prevent the high acidity and save the cells
- Organoid Cultures: Mini organs, that are created from stem cells.
- Stem Cell Creation Method
    - Blastocyst -> Embryonic Stem Cell -> Endoderm -> Converted to any cell type
    - Somatic Cell -> Induced Pluipotent Stem Cell -> Endoerm -> Coverted to any cell type
 -  Air-Liquid Interface Cultures: Are cells that are on a dish that get fed and then they grow into multiple cell cultures
 -  Cytopathic Effect (CPE): Is the term used to determine if the cells were succefully infected with the virus. Usally some form of degergration. Not all viruses will have effects
- Syncytia: Happens when cells are caused to fuse into large collection of nucluses. It happens when infected cell has a virus receptor on the cell, and a neboring cell has the reciver of the receptor, causing fusion.
- Plaque Assay, uses a petry dish that is covered in bacteria. Mesurering the virus infection and amount of virus
    - Create a Virus stock
    - Dillude it into a 1:10 -> 1:100 -> 1:1000
    - You take last three
    - put 0.1 ml on the plate for 45mins
    - Agar overlay, that solidifys 
    - stain the cells
    - count the placks of infected and dead cells due to the virus
    - Mesurments is PFU/ml
    - Take the minus sign off the delution (like 10^-7) and also if you take 1 more 10^1 off due to only using 0.1 ml
    - Dose response curve
- Agar it is a carbo hydrate like Jello that covers and stabizes
-
