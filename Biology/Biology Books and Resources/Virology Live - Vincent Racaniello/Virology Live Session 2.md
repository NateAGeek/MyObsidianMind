## Bullet Notes
- The infection Cycle
  - Everything that happens from the virus going into the cell and exploding out
- susceptible cell is when the cell has a receptor for the virus to bind and insert itself into the cell
- Resistant cell means it does not have a receptor to bind or can not allow the virus replication
- Permissive cell has the capability to replicate the cell
- Only susceptible and permissive cell are the only types that can support virus infection cycle
- Embryo egg has been used to grow virus cultures
- [[Fibroblasts]] are cells that make up that secrete 
- continuous cell lines: basically immortal cells and are cancerous
- Incubation happens at 37C and there is about 5% cubic carbon dioxide in the air for buffers
- Buffers are usually used to control deposits from cells to keep the alive. For example cells will deposit citric acid to maintain homeostasis. If a petre dish would to accumulate all the citric acid then the cell culture would die due to high acidity. Buffers prevent the high acidity and save the cells
- Organoid Cultures: Mini organs, that are created from stem cells.
- Stem Cell Creation Method
  - Blastocyst -> Embryonic Stem Cell -> Endoderm -> Converted to any cell type
  - Somatic Cell -> Induced Pluipotent Stem Cell -> Endoerm -> Coverted to any cell type
- Air-Liquid Interface Cultures: Are cells that are on a dish that get fed and then they grow into multiple cell cultures
- Cytopathic Effect (CPE): Is the term used to determine if the cells were succefully infected with the virus. Usally some form of degergration. Not all viruses will have effects
- Syncytia: Happens when cells are caused to fuse into large collection of nucluses. It happens when infected cell has a virus receptor on the cell, and a neboring cell has the reciver of the receptor, causing fusion.
- Plaque Assay, uses a petry dish that is covered in bacteria. Mesurering the virus infection and amount of virus
  - Create a Virus stock
  - Dillude it into a 1:10 -> 1:100 -> 1:1000
  - You take last three
  - put 0.1 ml on the plate for 45mins
  - Agar overlay, that solidifys
  - stain the cells
  - count the placks of infected and dead cells due to the virus
  - Mesurments is PFU/ml
  - Take the minus sign off the delution (like 10^-7) and also if you take 1 more 10^1 off due to only using 0.1 ml
  - Dose response curve
- Agar it is a carbo hydrate like Jello that covers and stabizes
- You can use Plaques to isolate Virus, by pipeppetig a viral region in a plaque(you can purify it by doing it multiple times)
- Some viruses can't be form on plaques, endpoint dilution assay
- Dilution assay is a series of virus piped into growing array of dilluted viruses. You then find the row with most diliuted to 50% and get the TCID score
- Particle/PFU is the ratio used to determine how infectious a virus is to their particles produced. Some are very infectious and others are not. Many particles are broken and mutated and damaged. Can very per cell type and animal
- Look at Plauqe assay on his yt channel
- moi is a way to determine different so many ways an assay gets a virus
- hemagglutination: is the measure of virus that is on a blood cells. They will over stick and create a sheet. Know as HH Titar 
- Assay for Enzyme in cells
- Antibody base assay. ELISA is a antibody with indicator to detect antibodies of viral enzymes
- ELISA is used for lateral flow essay. Antibodies pick up viral target by antibody and then those will be captured the the antibody on the positive line.
- genome sequencing 
- Phylogenetic Trees is a method that compares sequences and then creates a tree that determines what is most similar to others
- Polymerase Chain Reaction: denature the dna, and then put in dna primers on them and grow them again to detect the dna
