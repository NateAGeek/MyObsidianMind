## Bullet Notes
- The infection Cycle
    - Everything that happens from the virus going into the cell and exploding out
- susceptible cell is when the cell has a receptor for the virus to bind and insert itself into the cell
- Resistant cell means it does not have a receptor to bind or can not allow the virus replication
- Permissive cell has the capability to replicate the cell
- Only susceptible and permissive cell are the only types that can support virus infection cycle
- Embryo egg has been used to grow virus cultures 
- fibroblasts(need to define)
- continuous cell lines: basically immortal cells and are cancerous 
- Incubation happens at 37C and there is about 5% cubic carbon dioxide in the air for buffers
- Buffers are usually used to control deposits from cells to keep the alive. For example cells will deposit citric acid to maintain homeostasis. If a petre dish would to accumulate all the citric acid then the cell culture would die due to high acidity. Buffers prevent the high acidity and save the cells
