# Eukaryotic Cells
### Summary
Eukaryotic cells are a multicellular organism. They consist [[Membrane#Libid BiLayer]] that protects the cell and acts as a form of communication between cells, with specific proteins or molecules. These membranes can also collapse and reform with the help of the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton can provide the cell structure with three different filaments: Actin Filament, microtubules, and intermittent filament. The cell contains a
