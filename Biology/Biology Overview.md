# Biology Overview
Biology is a wonderful subject. It is about taking the heart of both Physics and Chemistry and putting it together into one subject. Although these subjects are not explored to their full extent in biology, there are still countless statistical and chemical changes that need a deep understanding of physics and chemistry.

Starting off small we have basic atomic theory. This is the most simplistic view of the world, (without getting into subatomic particles). These atomic particles bind together and create atoms that are the building blocks of elements. Elements begin to create larger more complex forms of matter called compounds. These compounds are connected by bonds(Ionic, covalent, hydrogen, metallic bond).
