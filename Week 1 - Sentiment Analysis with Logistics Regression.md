# Overview
When developing a sentiment analysis algorithm with neural networks and natural language. We need a series of labeled data that determines the sentiment of phrases. We then take a series of that input, and create/extract features from the phrasing. Passing into a logistic regression algorithm we then predict if it is positive or negative.
