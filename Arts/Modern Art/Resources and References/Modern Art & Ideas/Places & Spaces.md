## The Starry Night
### Vincent Van Gogh
St Paul was a nice place, guardians, mountains, landscapes. However, the area is not what is most know, rather the piece called Stary Night by Vincant Van Gogh. Vincent had checked himself in after a mental breakdown and spent his time recovering. Encouraged to paint as a means to help his recover. In he journals he wrote how he struggled to capture night correctly, and this is what lead him to take a more stylistic approach to the starry night. Starry Night is a collection of different parts of St Paul, mountains, trees, landscapes, towns. The actual view in Starry night does not exist it was all an interpretation and collection of hist surroundings.

## Broadway Boogie Woogie
### Piet Mondrian
Had to run away from paris during WW2. He arrived into New York and got an exposure to the surroundings. It caused him to change his style up and made Broadway Boogie Woogie. He pioneered De Stijl, a form of that rejected the naturalistic representation in favor of stripped down fundamental shapes, colors, lines, rectangles, to create visual harmony.

## Gordon Matta-Clark
### Bingo
During the 1970s Niagara falls had fallen, industry jobs going abroad and the city was falling apart. Matta-Clark wanted to show this falling apart using his architecture background, something he used for art than a career. He cut a house into 9 squares and created a bingo board. The center square remained only to be destroyed. He defined this as "anarchitecture", a combination of anarchy and architecture.

## Norman Lewis
### City Night
Lewis's painting was abstract. However, in the City night you see the presience of a city with just the dramatic shapes and textures. It is something that used crisscross lines to show laundry and power lines. But through the abstraction you can see a city night.
