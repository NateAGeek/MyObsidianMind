## The Starry Night
### [[Vincent Van Gogh]]
St Paul was a nice place, guardians, mountains, landscapes. However, the area is not what is most know, rather the piece called Starry Night by Vincant Van Gogh. Vincent had checked himself in after a mental breakdown and spent his time recovering. Encouraged to paint as a means to help his recover. In he journals he wrote how he struggled to capture night correctly, and this is what lead him to take a more stylistic approach to the starry night. Starry Night is a collection of different parts of St Paul, mountains, trees, landscapes, towns. The actual view in Starry night does not exist it was all an interpretation and collection of hist surroundings.

## [[Gordon Matta-Clark]]
### Bingo
During the 1970s Niagara falls had fallen, industry jobs going abroad and the city was falling apart. Matta-Clark wanted to show this falling apart using his architecture background, something he used for art than a career. He cut a house into 9 squares and created a bingo board. The center square remained only to be destroyed. He defined this as "anarchitecture", a combination of anarchy and architecture.

## [[Norman Lewis]]
### City Night
Lewis's painting was abstract. However, in the City night you see the prescience of a city with just the dramatic shapes and textures. It is something that used crisscross lines to show laundry and power lines. But through the abstraction you can see a city night.

### The Persistence of Memory
Dali's work of The Persistence of Memory calls back to his uncanny memory of a coastline in native Catalonia Spain. However, as seen in the work, the realism is mixed with non-rational mechanisms. Dali work typically applies methods of surrealism, a projection of dream like imaginary understanding of the world in almost a subcutaneous way.

### House by the Railroad
Edward produced urban views, landscapes, and interior scenes. Thought he insist his paintings were straightforward representations of the real world, they do have more of an isolating distance to them. the tracks make a visual barrier pushing what was forgotten into the background, the old fashion home.
