Identity is how we perceive and express ourselves. It is a condition of the individual - ethnic heritage, sex, or even ones body. Expressing these identities through art can share a deeper self-reflection. Also, can act as a store of time, and change/progression on how one views themselves and others.  The three main forms of Identity explored in this module appear to be how one sees themself, how others see them, and how the public views them.
