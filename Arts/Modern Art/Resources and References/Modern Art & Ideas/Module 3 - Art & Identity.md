Identity is how we perceive and express ourselves. It is a condition of the individual - ethnic heritage, sex, or even ones body. Expressing these identities through art can share a deeper self-reflection. Also, can act as a store of time, and change/progression on how one views themselves and others.  The three main forms of Identity explored in this module appear to be how one sees themself, how others see them, and how the public views them.

Glenn asked 10 of his friends to give a description of missing person report of himself. He then used these words and remixed them with runaway posters of slaves. This was to depict how even the most meaningful descriptions can still have impact based on the framing of the identity. Provoking how people thought through the history of slavery and identity is not escaped so easily.

Post Marilyn Monroe's suicide from overdosing. Andy wanted to immortalize her while representing the commercialization of her image by the public. How she was held within this golden light and used as a source of public and considered a "modern day goddess". But overall these commercialization of her left her with more anxiety and depression.
