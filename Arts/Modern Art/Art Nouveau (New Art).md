Is a style of art that is primarily focused on the natural forms of nature, expressing sinuous curves and organic flows, with dynamism and movement given by deep asymmetry or whiplash lines.

It was an art style popular in the 1890 - 1910s. The work was largely exhausted in the 1920s, post first world war. Art Nouveau largely became replaced with [[Art Deco(Decorative Arts)]] and [[Modernism]]. However, it did became more positively influence and critical in the 1960s with major exhibitions of work of Hector Guimard, at the MoMA.
