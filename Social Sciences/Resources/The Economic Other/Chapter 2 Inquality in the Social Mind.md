    * [[../../Gini Coefficient]] is a standard coefficient used to determine income inequality
    * Support for the three policy types(welfare, Social Security, and education) has been really staggering and zigzags in regards for wealth distribution(Gini Coefficient) and desired support(maintaining same regions).

    * However, the system is too large to properly allow individuals to realize that global state, the state of "[[../../../Humanities/Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseauean]]". So, we end up relying on Cross-Class and localize Social Comparison to align our beliefs of self value in relation to the global American System.
