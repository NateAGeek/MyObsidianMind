A geometric distribution is the aspect of probability a series of events that are failures before you have a success. Aka, what is the probability until a state change occurs in your series of experiments. You can represent it as follows:
$$
P(X = k) = (1-p)^{k-1} p
$$
Where $(1-p)^{k-1}$ is the probability of "failure" and p is the probability of success.
