Hidden Markov Models are models that represent a series of data of hidden states, observations, transitions probabilities, and emission probabilities.

1. **Hidden states**: These are the states that the model transitions between, but they aren't directly observable.
2. **Observations**: These are the data points that we can see, which are generated by the hidden states.
3. **Transition probabilities**: The probabilities of transitioning from one hidden state to another.
4. **Emission probabilities**: The probabilities of a particular observation being generated from a given hidden state.
