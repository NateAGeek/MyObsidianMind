Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) are equations that have a single independent variable.
Partial Differential Equations (PDE) are equations that multiple, more than one, independent variable.

Note: Some Differential Equations can more than one solution, and subsequently will have a set of solutions. 

Initial Value Problems, are when the the differential equation is input and output is given for initial cases of different orders of derivates for the function. For example y(0) = 2, and y'(3) = 2

Boundary Value Problems: is then the problem defines the variables for the given function(thus setting a boundary on the function). y(1) = 2 and y(5) = 1 

Models are entangled formulations that have directional changes when one or more of the variables changes. They are seen as formulaic relations of cause and effects that can change together or differently.
