**Finite Probability Space**: is a space where we have a finite amount of outcomes

In context we define a set of elements of outcomes, such as a series of possible coin flips. 

$$
\Omega = \{HHH,HHT,HTH,HTT,THH,THT,TTH,TTT\}
$$
We can defined the probability of $H$ as $p$ and the probability of $T$ as $q$, where $q = 1 - p$. We can define the individual elements as $w$(where a sequence of three tosses would be $w = w_1w_2w_3$). The example of $\Omega$ independent elements we could define the probability as follows.
