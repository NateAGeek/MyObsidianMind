Is a form of demension redictopm to extract and for dominant patterns. Further defines the data in a new cordinate system defined by dominant correlations from the data.

We define a data set as follows $X \in \mathbb{C}^{n\times{m}}$ Where $n$ represents the number of rows and $m$ is the number of columns.

We can select columns that represent series of data. Such as transformed images or velocities from a fluid simulation. We do this with the following format: $x_k \in \mathbb{C}^n$ where $k$ represents the column being selected.
