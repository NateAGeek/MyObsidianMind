### Support Vector Machine
Are classifying machines that learn the separation boundaries between features. They use a ideal mid point and margin to allow wiggle room when classifying

They also will use kernels to transform the data to better create degrees of separation of data and make the hyperplanes fit and classify the data.

### K-Nearest Neighbors
