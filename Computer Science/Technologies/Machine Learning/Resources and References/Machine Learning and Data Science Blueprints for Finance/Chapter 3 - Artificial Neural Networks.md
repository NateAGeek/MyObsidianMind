### Backpropagation
Taking the known $Y$ predicted value and the $\tilde{Y}$ output produced by the model, you can mind their loss via some function, then optimize via gradient descent. Essentially you then find the outputs of the loss function you have to derive the loss function in relation to the layers, with respect to $w$. This gives you a final direction to guide the loss and optimize the the model.
