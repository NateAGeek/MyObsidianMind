## Decision Trees
Is a tree that takes conditional nodes to determine and potential classify the label. The **Root Node** trickles down into the children and determines the possible output.

## Building a Decision Tree
* Find a feature that will be the root node of the decision. We keep splitting features until we gain our insight into our labels and find classification. Where the collection is fully separated 
* Determine when to stop splitting. When the final nodes fully classify the items. Or limit the depth
