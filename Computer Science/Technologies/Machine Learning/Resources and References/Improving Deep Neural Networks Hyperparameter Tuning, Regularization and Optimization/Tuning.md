## Overview

Hyperperparameters: they are the high level variables that can be used to develop the model and fit it. The following in this order are suggested.
- Alpha
- Momentum Terms
- Layers
- Hidden Units
- Mini-batch size
Suggestion is to take a demential choice of different hyperparameters. Random tends to help as it allows to better explore different parameters.

Smaller and smaller regions of random areas can allow for better fine tuning.

### Appropriate Hyperparams Searching at Random
Although we were suggesting to pick parameters at random we have to account that we want to pick them at a uniform scale. As we could optimize our region of parameters more accurately.

Uniformly randomly searching on a log scale as it will allow us to more target look for parameters.
