## Train/Test/Dev
Machine learning is a highly iterative process
Guessing Hyperparamters is hard. Hyperparameters are layers, structure, learning rate, etc.

### Big Data
Makes out evaluation and test set we now have smaller amount to test and cross evaluate.

### Distribution 
It is important to ideally have test set come from the same set as it could make sure our data is trend.
