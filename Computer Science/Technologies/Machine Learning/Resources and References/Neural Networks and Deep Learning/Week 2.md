## Binary Classification 
We use logistic regression to determine a classification. 

We represent our samples as a series of pairs $(x, y)$ with a notation of where $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n_x}$ and $y \in \{0,1\}$ 
Where $n_x$ represents how many features we have. We sometimes represent a our number of samples with $m$ and further denote specific sub selections with $m_{train}$.

We can denote the whole training collection with a capital "$X$" as follows $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n_x\times m}$
