## [[Supervised Learning]]
Are algorithms that take inputs and attempt to produce the correct output label, label meaning correct expected definition of the output.  X to Y mapping

**[[Regression]]**: Attempting to find a the best expected number from a series of data. It can produced any number, meaning it s output is not necessarily fixed but granular in possible output.

**[[Classification]]**: Is the fixed value expected given an input. Basically categorizing data to fixed labels, and those can be non-numeric.
