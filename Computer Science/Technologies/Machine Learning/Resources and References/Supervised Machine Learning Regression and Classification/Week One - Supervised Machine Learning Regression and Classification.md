## [[../../Supervised Learning|Supervised Learning]]
Are algorithms that take inputs and attempt to produce the correct output label, label meaning correct expected definition of the output.  X to Y mapping. The aspects of the algorithm is to produces a result given the input follows the characteristics "learned"/modeled from the data set.

**[[Regression]]**: Attempting to find a the best expected number from a series of data. It can produced any number, meaning it s output is not necessarily fixed but granular in possible output.

**[[Classification]]**: Is the fixed value expected given an input. Basically categorizing data to fixed labels, and those can be non-numeric.

## [[../../Unsupervised Learning | Unsupervised Learning]]
Are algorithms that take inputs and attempt discover patterns within the data. They are not algorithms that are meant to produces a single result given input. However, rather help define sets and patterns in data. 

[[Clustering]]
Is used to find relational regions of data within a dataset to discover similarities across data. This can be dimensional where we can identify similar relations.

[[Anomaly Detection]]
This algorithm technique is used to discover unusual data points.

[[Dimensionality Reduction]]
Compressing data, while loosing minimal amount of data.
