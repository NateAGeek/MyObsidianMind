## Multiple Features
When dealing with multiple features for a model, you can take the dot product on the inputs and the weights + a bias to fit the data.
**Dot Product:** is the multiplication of each items index summed together. 
$$
\vec{x} \cdot \vec{w} = x_1(w_1) + x_2(w_2) + x_3(w_3)...
$$
## Vectorization
Is a computational technique that allows vectors to be calculated faster. Though the process of using extra large registers to do math at once. Like SIMD and AVX specs
