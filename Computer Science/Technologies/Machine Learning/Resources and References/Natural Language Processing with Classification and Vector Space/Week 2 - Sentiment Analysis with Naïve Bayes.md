## Bayes' Rule
First calculate the total probability of an event or action to happen. In the context of tweets of 20, how many are label positive and negative. 13 positive and 7 negative. We then find the probability of a positive event happening. 13/20 = 0.65. We can subtract 1 from the positive probability to find the negation.

We can then take the union of the possibility of multiple cases. Such as a word in both aspects and then determine its probability.

We can extract the now conditional probability that a positive tweet has happy or happy is in a positive tweet.
