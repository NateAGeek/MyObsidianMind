## Bayes' Rule
First calculate the total probability of an event or action to happen. In the context of tweets of 20, how many are label positive and negative. 13 positive and 7 negative. We then find the probability of a positive event happening. 13/20 = 0.65. We can subtract 1 from the positive probability to find the negation.
