# Overview
The Fulcrum Choke is like a [[Rear Naked Choke]], however, the forearm is behind the back pushing the head into the interlocking arms. This creates leverage on the chin or neck, pulling the head and creating a pulling force choke rather than a suffocation choke.

_Example: Connor vs Khabib (UFC 229), Connor had to tap due to the force._
