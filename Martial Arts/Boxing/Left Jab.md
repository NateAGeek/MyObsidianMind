## Overview
The left jab is a common punch in boxing used to create distance and test distance for leading shots. It is important to drive the punch with the back leg up to the full extension of the punch. The jab utilizes three components of the body to deliver the maximum strength, stability, and force. These components in combination with speed tend to lead to as much power as the K.O. punch. The components consist of the lower leg, hip to upper back, and finally in the extension of the arm.

### Upper Arm Mechanics
The jab utilizes the elbow extension and forearm rotation, to corkscrew the force and better handle impact on the wrist. This activation happens in the triceps extension and the forearm rotation to dive the punch. The initial stance of the upper body is elbow down and arm retracted in. Then using the lower body to drive the punch, release/drive the force with with the elbow extension towards the target. It is important to corkscrew the wrist to not only add a bit more of force behind the punch, but also it allows for the forearm to biomechanically handle the impact from the punch.

TODO: Find better research on the tricep activation and the forearm rotation.

### Mid Body Mechanics
The mid body's job is to transfer the Torque
